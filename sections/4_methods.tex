\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data}

Data was used for all emergency stroke admissions to England and Wales for the 5 years 2017-2021, for teams with average admissions of at least 100 per year. The total number of patients were, 301,747, of which 114,277 (38\%) arrived within 4 hours of known stroke onset. Of those arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset 102,971 (90\%) arrived by ambulance. Outcome modelling is based on all arrivals, but the stroke pathway modelling is based on those arriving by ambulance within 4 hours of known stroke onset.
