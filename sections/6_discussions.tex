\section{Discussion}


A difference between the general emergency stroke population compared with the thrombolysis clinical trial population is that patients with mild stroke (NIHSS 0-4) make up 47\% of the general emergency stroke population (arriving by ambulance), but only 10\% of the trial population \cite{emberson_effect_2014}. Patients with mild stroke make up a significant part of the stroke population, and this is a group where there is significant variation in enthusiasm to use thrombolsysis. Our analysis showed that patients with mild stroke could still benefit from thrombolysis, but the benefit is smaller than in more severe stroke (as there is less room for improvement); extrapolating from clinical trial populations to the general population may, therefore, somewhat over-estimate the benefit available.
